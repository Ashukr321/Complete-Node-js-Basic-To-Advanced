- [NodeJs-docs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to create scalable and fast network applications. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. 

Node.js is often used for building server-side applications, web servers, APIs, and real-time applications.
