# Complete Node_Js Basic To Advacned üöÄ
- [NodeJs-docs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to create scalable and fast network applications. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. 

Node.js is often used for building server-side applications, web servers, APIs, and real-time applications.

## Top Node js Frameworks 
### Express.js
* Express.js is the most popular and minimalistic web framework for Node.js. 
Express is designed to simplify the backend application development with a robust set of features including routing, middleware, error handling, and templating.
### Nest.js
* Nest.js is a progressive framework for Node.js for building server-side applications with JavaScript and TypeScript. 
* Nest.js follows a modular architecture enabling developers to create complex applications by organizing components into separate, independent modules, ensuring maintainability and reusability across various parts of the application.
### Realtime Node.js Frameworks
* Realtime frameworks provide features and functions to enable simplified development of realtime applications. Realtime applications require realtime flow of information, like with instant messaging or for data analytics dashboards. Here are some of the best realtime Node.js frameworks to consider:

* Socket.IO: Socket.IO is a Node.js framework built on top of WebSockets that enables realtime client-server communication. Socket.IO is event-driven and compatible with older browsers and environments.

## Express installation
### Step 1: Install Express.js
    npm install express
### Step 2: Create a New File

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    // Define a route for the root URL ('/') that returns 'Hello World!'
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    
    // Start the server
    const port = 3000;
    app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
    });
### Step 3: Run the Server
    node app.js
#

## Installing NestJS
- [Nest js  Docs üìî ](https://nestjs.com/)
### Step 1: Install Node.js
### Step 2: Install NestJS CLI
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
### Step 3: Create a New Project
    nest new project-name
### Step 4: Install Dependencies
    npm install
### Step 5: Start the Development Server
    npm run start

## Important  Dependencies üßë‚Äçüíª
### Node.js nodemon npm Module
The nodemon npm Module is a module that develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Nodemon does not require any change in the original code and method of development.

    npm install -g nodemon
### check the current version of the module
    nodemon version
##  body-parser
Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the
    req.body 

    npm i body-parser
## cors
* The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) npm module is a Node.js package that enables cross-origin resource sharing for Express.js applications.
* It allows web pages to make requests to a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one the web page was loaded from, which is a restriction imposed by the same-origin policy.
#
    npm i cors
#
    app.use(cors({
    origin: '*',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
    headers: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
    }));

## dotenv 
Dotenv is a popular Node.js package that loads environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object. This allows you to separate sensitive or environment-specific configuration from your code and keep it organized in a single file.

    npm install dotenv


## Pm2 
PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer

* Application run Forever unit we stop manually üöÄ


Installation ‚≠ê‚≠ê

    npm install pm2 -g

To list all running applications:

    pm2 list

To check Version 

    pm2 --version
To start server

    pm2 start app.js
